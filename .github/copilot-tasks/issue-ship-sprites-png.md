# Coding Agent Task: Generate PNG Ship Sprites (Proof of Concept)

**Title:** Generate placeholder PNG ship sprites for programmer art

**Description:**
- Create PNG images for player ship sprites as described in the MVP and asset planning
- Each ship sprite should be a 32x32 pixel PNG
- Visual style: circle outline with triangle arrow inside, pointing in facing direction
- Generate at least 8 variants (one for each 45-degree rotation)
- Save images to `assets/ships/` or similar directory
- Use open-source Node.js or JavaScript libraries (e.g., node-canvas, pngjs) to generate images programmatically
- Document the process and code used for future reference
- These assets are placeholders and will be replaced by concept art or polished sprites later

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] At least 8 PNG ship sprites generated (32x32 px, different facing directions)
- [ ] Images saved to `assets/ships/` or similar
- [ ] Code for image generation included in repo
- [ ] Documentation of process/code provided
- [ ] Assets are usable as programmer art placeholders

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes

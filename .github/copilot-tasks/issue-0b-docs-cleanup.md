# Task: Remove Python server references from all documentation and scripts

## Problem Statement
Documentation and setup guides reference Python for serving the frontend, which is inconsistent with our Node.js/Yarn stack. All Python references must be removed and replaced with Yarn/Node.js instructions.

## Expected Deliverables
- Audit all documentation, README files, and setup guides for any mention of Python or `python3 -m http.server`
- Replace with Yarn-based or Node.js-based dev server instructions
- Ensure onboarding and quickstart guides are consistent with project stack
- Validate no Python references remain in any docs or scripts

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All documentation references Yarn/Node.js for dev server
- [ ] No mention of Python or `python3 -m http.server` remains
- [ ] Quickstart and onboarding guides are up to date
- [ ] Team members can follow docs without confusion

## Time Constraints
Research: 5 minutes, Implementation: 15 minutes

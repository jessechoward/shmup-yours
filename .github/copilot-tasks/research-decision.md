- [ ] **Implementation Speed** - Development velocity priority  
- [ ] **Maintainability** - Long-term code health
- [ ] **Learning Curve** - Team onboarding ease
- [ ] **Community Support** - Documentation, updates, ecosystem

**Constraints:**
- Time budget for implementation
- Team skill level
- Project scope and timeline
- Technical debt tolerance

## üèÜ Final Decision
**Chosen Option:** [Selected solution]

**Rationale (3 key reasons):**
1. **Primary Benefit:** Why this best fits our needs
2. **Risk Mitigation:** How this reduces project risk
3. **Future-Proofing:** Why this scales with project growth

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- What we're giving up by not choosing alternatives
- Acceptable limitations or compromises

## üöÄ Implementation Plan
**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Task 1:** [Specific 15-min implementation task]
2. **Task 2:** [Specific 15-min implementation task]
3. **Task 3:** [Integration/testing task]

**Success Metrics:**
- How we'll know this decision was correct
- Performance benchmarks to hit
- Key functionality to verify

## üîó Handoff Information
**For Implementation Teams:**
- Specific libraries/tools to use
- Configuration requirements
- Integration points with existing code
- Documentation/tutorial links

**Risk Monitoring:**
- Potential issues to watch for during implementation
- Fallback options if problems arise

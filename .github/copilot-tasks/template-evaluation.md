## 📊 Template Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Data Collection

**Escalation Analysis:**
```markdown
## Template Performance Review: [Template Name]

**Period:** [Date range]
**Issues Using Template:** [Count]
**Escalations:** [Count and percentage]

**Escalation Breakdown:**
- 3-iteration limit: [Count] ([Percentage]%)
- Technical blockers: [Count] ([Percentage]%)
- Scope expansion: [Count] ([Percentage]%)
- Quality gates: [Count] ([Percentage]%)

**Success Metrics:**
- Average completion time: [Minutes]
- Success rate: [Percentage]
- Re-work rate: [Percentage]
```

**Agent Feedback Collection:**
```markdown
## Agent Experience Report

**Template Used:** [Template name]
**Issue Number:** #[number]
**Outcome:** [Success/Escalation]

**Clarity Issues Encountered:**
- [Issue 1]: [Description and impact]
- [Issue 2]: [Description and impact]

**Missing Information:**
- [Gap 1]: [What was unclear]
- [Gap 2]: [What was missing]

**Time Estimate Issues:**
- Estimated: [Time]
- Actual: [Time]
- Variance Reason: [Why difference occurred]
```

### Step 2: Root Cause Analysis

**Common Escalation Patterns:**

**Pattern A: Scope Creep During Implementation**
```markdown
**Symptoms:**
- Requirements seem simple but grow complex during implementation
- Edge cases not anticipated in original template
- Integration complexity underestimated

**Template Improvements:**
- Add explicit scope boundaries section
- Include common edge case checklist
- Provide integration complexity assessment
```

**Pattern B: Technical Approach Unclear**
```markdown
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple viable approaches without clear guidance
- Architecture decisions required beyond agent scope
- Performance/security trade-offs not specified

**Template Improvements:**
- Add preferred technical approach guidance
- Include architecture decision criteria
- Specify performance/security requirements explicitly
```

**Pattern C: Acceptance Criteria Gaps**
```markdown
**Symptoms:**
- Core functionality implemented but edge cases fail
- Testing approach unclear or incomplete
- Success criteria subjective or unmeasurable

**Template Improvements:**
- Expand acceptance criteria with specific examples
- Add comprehensive testing scenario checklist
- Include measurable success metrics
```

### Step 3: Template Enhancement

**Enhancement Priority Matrix:**
```
High Impact, Low Effort:
- Clarify ambiguous wording
- Add missing edge case examples
- Fix time estimate calculations

High Impact, High Effort:
- Restructure template organization
- Add new template sections
- Create template variations for complexity levels

Low Impact, Low Effort:
- Fix typos and formatting
- Update example code snippets
- Improve cross-references

Low Impact, High Effort:
- Complete template redesign
- Multi-template workflow creation
```

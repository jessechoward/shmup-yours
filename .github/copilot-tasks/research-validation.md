# Research Validation Task Template

## üîç Validation Objective
Review and validate findings from a research task, providing alternative perspectives and recommendations.

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gate Compliance
**Pre-Task Validation:**
- [ ] Quality hooks are active and functional
- [ ] Documentation tools are available

**Resolution Playbook References:**
- Package Manager Issues: `.github/hooks/package-manager-errors.md`
- ESLint/Quality Issues: `.github/hooks/eslint-errors.md`
- Performance Issues: `.github/hooks/performance-errors.md`
- Emergency Procedures: `.github/hooks/emergency-overrides.md`

## üìã Source Research
**Original Research Task:** #123 (link to research task)  
**Research Question:** Copy the original research question  
**Original Findings:** 
```markdown
// Paste key findings from original research
- Option A: Pros/Cons
- Option B: Pros/Cons  
- Recommendation: X because Y
```

## üéØ Validation Focus
**Critical Analysis Areas:**
- [ ] **Assumption Challenges** - Are the assumptions valid?
- [ ] **Alternative Options** - Were other approaches considered?
- [ ] **Risk Assessment** - Are risks properly identified?
- [ ] **Implementation Reality** - Is the recommendation practical?
- [ ] **Cost/Benefit Analysis** - Does the math make sense?

**Questions to Answer:**
- What did the original research miss?
- Are there simpler alternatives?
- What are the hidden risks or costs?
- Does this align with project constraints?

## üîß Validation Approach
**Independent Analysis:**
1. **Fresh Perspective** - Approach the problem independently
2. **Alternative Research** - Look for different options/approaches
3. **Devil's Advocate** - Challenge the original conclusions
4. **Practical Assessment** - Consider real-world implementation

**Comparison Framework:**
| Criteria | Original Option | Alternative Option | Winner | Why |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-----|
| Performance | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Complexity | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Maintainability | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## ‚úÖ Validation Output
**Agreement Areas:**
- What aspects of the original research are solid
- Which conclusions are well-supported

**Disagreement Areas:**
- Where you see different conclusions
- Alternative approaches to consider
- Risks or issues not addressed

**Final Recommendation:**
- Confirm original recommendation, OR
- Suggest alternative approach, OR  
- Request additional research on specific areas

## üîó Handoff Information
**For Decision Agent:**
- Clear recommendation with rationale
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Implementation next steps
- Any remaining unknowns that need resolution

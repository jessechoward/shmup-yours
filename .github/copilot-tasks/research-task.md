# Research Task Template

## üîç Research Objective
Clear question or problem to investigate.

## üöÄ Development Environment Setup
**Quality Gates Activation:**
```bash
# Enable Husky hooks for quality enforcement
yarn install  # Installs dependencies including hook infrastructure
yarn workspace backend install
yarn workspace frontend install

# Verify quality gates are active
yarn lint:all    # Should run ESLint across all workspaces
yarn test:all    # Should run tests (if configured)
```

**Hook Verification:**
```bash
# Test that quality gates are working
echo "console.log('test')" > temp-test-file.js
git add temp-test-file.js
git commit -m "test quality gates" --dry-run
# Should trigger linting and other quality checks
rm temp-test-file.js
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Gate Compliance
**Pre-Research Validation:**
- [ ] Quality hooks are active and functional
- [ ] ESLint configuration is working (`yarn lint:all`)
- [ ] Documentation tools are available
- [ ] Workspace isolation is maintained (yarn workspaces)

**Violation Resolution:**
- Educational error messages will guide you to quick fixes
- 90% of violations have copy-paste resolution commands
- Escalate after 5 minutes if resolution unclear
- Reference: `.github/hooks/README.md` for detailed guidance

## ‚úÖ Deliverables
**Quality Compliance (Required for all tasks):**
- [ ] All documentation passes quality gates (if applicable)
- [ ] No package manager violations (yarn-only enforcement)
- [ ] Educational error messages reviewed if violations occurred
- [ ] Quality hook performance remains under 30 seconds
- [ ] No emergency overrides used (except documented emergencies)

**Research Outputs:**
- [ ] **Summary Document** - Key findings and recommendations
- [ ] **Comparison Matrix** - Options vs. criteria
- [ ] **Implementation Notes** - How to proceed with chosen solution
- [ ] **Risk Assessment** - Potential issues and mitigation strategies

**Pre-Commit Verification:**
- [ ] `git commit` completes without quality gate failures
- [ ] Hook execution time is reasonable (<30 seconds)
- [ ] All documentation follows project conventions
- [ ] No `--no-verify` flags used (unless emergency documented)

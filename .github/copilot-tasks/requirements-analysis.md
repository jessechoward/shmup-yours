# Requirements Analysis Task Template

## 📖 Analysis Objective
Break down a user story or feature into implementable technical requirements.

## 🛡️ Quality Gate Compliance
**Pre-Task Validation:**
- [ ] Quality hooks are active and functional
- [ ] Documentation tools are available

**Resolution Playbook References:**
- Package Manager Issues: `.github/hooks/package-manager-errors.md`
- ESLint/Quality Issues: `.github/hooks/eslint-errors.md`
- Performance Issues: `.github/hooks/performance-errors.md`
- Emergency Procedures: `.github/hooks/emergency-overrides.md`

## 📋 Source Material
**User Story:** #123 (link to user story task)
**Story Summary:**
```
As a [user type]
I want [goal]
So that [benefit]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Copy acceptance criteria from user story
- Identify any ambiguities or gaps

## 🔧 Technical Breakdown
**Component Analysis:**
- **Frontend Requirements:**
  - UI components needed
  - User interaction flows
  - State management needs

- **Backend Requirements:**
  - API endpoints required
  - Business logic components
  - Data storage needs

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Real-time communication needs
  - Data synchronization requirements
  - Error handling flows

## 📊 Implementation Tasks
**Task Breakdown:**
1. **Research Task:** (if needed)
   - What: [Research question]
   - Why: [Knowledge gap to fill]

2. **Backend Feature:**
   - What: [Specific backend functionality]
   - Scope: [Exact files and functions]

3. **Frontend Feature:**
   - What: [Specific UI/UX functionality]
   - Scope: [Exact components and interactions]

4. **Backend Tests:**
   - What: [Testing requirements]
   - Coverage: [Specific test scenarios]

5. **Frontend Tests:**
   - What: [Testing requirements]
   - Coverage: [Specific test scenarios]

6. **Integration:**
   - What: [Connection requirements]
   - Verification: [End-to-end scenarios]

## 🔄 Dependencies & Sequencing
**Sequential Dependencies:**
```
Research (if needed) → Backend Feature → Backend Tests
                   → Frontend Feature → Frontend Tests
                                    → Integration
```

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Backend and Frontend features can be developed simultaneously
- Tests can be written in parallel with features

# Requirements Analysis Task Template

## ðŸ“– Analysis Objective
Break down a user story or feature into implementable technical requirements.

## ðŸ“‹ Source Material
**User Story:** #123 (link to user story task)
**Story Summary:**
```
As a [user type]
I want [goal]
So that [benefit]
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Copy acceptance criteria from user story
- Identify any ambiguities or gaps

## ðŸ”§ Technical Breakdown
**Component Analysis:**
- **Frontend Requirements:**
  - UI components needed
  - User interaction flows
  - State management needs

- **Backend Requirements:**
  - API endpoints required
  - Business logic components
  - Data storage needs

- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Real-time communication needs
  - Data synchronization requirements
  - Error handling flows

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Tasks
**Task Breakdown:**
1. **Research Task:** (if needed)
   - What: [Research question]
   - Why: [Knowledge gap to fill]

2. **Backend Feature:**
   - What: [Specific backend functionality]
   - Scope: [Exact files and functions]

3. **Frontend Feature:**
   - What: [Specific UI/UX functionality]
   - Scope: [Exact components and interactions]

4. **Backend Tests:**
   - What: [Testing requirements]
   - Coverage: [Specific test scenarios]

5. **Frontend Tests:**
   - What: [Testing requirements]
   - Coverage: [Specific test scenarios]

6. **Integration:**
   - What: [Connection requirements]
   - Verification: [End-to-end scenarios]

## ðŸ”„ Dependencies & Sequencing
**Sequential Dependencies:**
```
Research (if needed) â†’ Backend Feature â†’ Backend Tests
                   â†’ Frontend Feature â†’ Frontend Tests
                                    â†’ Integration
```

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Backend and Frontend features can be developed simultaneously
- Tests can be written in parallel with features

## ðŸ“‹ Definition of Ready
**Each Task Should Include:**
- [ ] Clear objective and scope
- [ ] All necessary context and code snippets
- [ ] Specific file paths and function signatures
- [ ] Complete API contracts and data structures
- [ ] Success criteria and time boxing
- [ ] Handoff information for next tasks

## âœ… Output Requirements
**Task Creation Checklist:**
- [ ] All implementation tasks created with complete context
- [ ] Dependencies clearly mapped
- [ ] Acceptance criteria distributed across tasks
- [ ] No task exceeds 2-hour time box
- [ ] Each task can be completed independently
- [ ] Test tasks have clear coverage requirements

---
**Time Box:** 1-2 hours  
**Agent Focus:** Analysis and task creation only  
**Output:** Set of ready-to-execute implementation tasks

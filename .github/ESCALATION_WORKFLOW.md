# Issue Escalation Workflow

## Overview

This workflow defines the process for escalating issues when GitHub Copilot agents reach their 3-iteration limit or encounter unresolvable blockers. The escalation process ensures effective human intervention while capturing valuable data for continuous process improvement.

## üö® When to Escalate

### Automatic Escalation Triggers
1. **3-Iteration Limit Reached:** Agent has completed 3 time-boxed attempts without meeting success criteria
2. **Quality Gates Failed:** Unable to achieve 90% function coverage or 80% decision coverage
3. **Unresolvable Technical Blocker:** External dependencies, API limitations, or architecture constraints
4. **Scope Expansion:** Requirements grew significantly beyond original estimates during implementation

### Manual Escalation Triggers
1. **Critical Priority:** High-priority issues needing immediate human attention
2. **Domain Expertise Required:** Complex business logic or specialized technical knowledge needed
3. **Architecture Decision:** Implementation requires architectural changes beyond agent scope

## üìã Escalation Process

### Step 1: Agent Preparation (5 minutes)
When escalation is triggered, the agent must:

1. **Commit Current Work**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "WIP: Escalation - work completed through iteration [X]"
   git push origin [branch-name]
   ```

2. **Document Current State**
   - Capture error logs and test output
   - Note quality metrics (coverage, linting results)
   - Summarize decisions made and approaches tried

3. **Create Escalation Issue**
   - Use escalation issue template
   - Include all required evidence and context
   - Link to original issue and current branch

### Step 2: Human Review Assignment (Automatic)
The escalation issue triggers automatic assignment:

```yaml
# Escalation assignment rules:
- Backend issues ‚Üí @backend-team-lead
- Frontend issues ‚Üí @frontend-team-lead  
- Infrastructure ‚Üí @devops-lead
- Cross-cutting ‚Üí @tech-lead
- Research ‚Üí @product-owner
```

### Step 3: Human Review Process (30-60 minutes)

#### Initial Assessment (10 minutes)
1. **Review Original Issue**
   - Validate requirements clarity
   - Check acceptance criteria completeness
   - Assess time estimates accuracy

2. **Evaluate Agent Work**
   - Review code quality and approach
   - Analyze test coverage and gaps
   - Identify technical decisions made

3. **Determine Resolution Strategy**
   - Continue with agent (revised approach)
   - Human takeover (complex/specialized work)
   - Issue breakdown (scope too large)
   - Requirements clarification (ambiguous specs)

#### Resolution Execution (20-50 minutes)

**Option A: Revised Agent Approach**
```markdown
## Resolution: Revised Agent Assignment
**New Approach:** [Description of revised strategy]
**Time Box:** [New time estimate]
**Success Criteria:** [Updated/clarified criteria]
**Agent Guidance:** [Specific instructions for agent]
```

**Option B: Human Takeover**
```markdown
## Resolution: Human Implementation
**Assigned Developer:** [Name]
**Reason for Takeover:** [Why agent couldn't complete]
**Estimated Effort:** [Time estimate]
**Timeline:** [Expected completion date]
```

**Option C: Issue Breakdown**
```markdown
## Resolution: Task Decomposition
**Root Cause:** Task too large/complex for time box
**Sub-Issues Created:**
- #[new-issue] - [Core functionality - agent suitable]
- #[new-issue] - [Complex component - human required]
- #[new-issue] - [Integration work - agent suitable]
```

### Step 4: Process Improvement (10 minutes)

#### Template Evaluation
Document feedback on original task template:

```markdown
## Template Effectiveness Review
**Clarity Score:** [1-5] - How clear were requirements?
**Completeness Score:** [1-5] - Were acceptance criteria sufficient?
**Estimate Accuracy:** [1-5] - How accurate was time estimate?

**Specific Improvements Needed:**
- [Improvement 1]: [Description]
- [Improvement 2]: [Description]
```

#### Workflow Bottlenecks
Identify process issues that contributed to escalation:

```markdown
## Workflow Analysis
**Bottleneck Identified:** [Description]
**Impact:** [How it affected progress]
**Recommendation:** [How to prevent in future]
```

# üéØ Educational Hook Error Messages

## Overview
This directory contains educational error message templates that transform Git hooks from blockers into teachers. These messages guide agents toward resolution while maintaining development velocity and enforcing quality standards.

## Design Principles
- **Educational First**: Help agents understand WHY each rule exists
- **Actionable Guidance**: Provide specific, copy-paste fix commands
- **Clear Escalation**: Define when to seek help vs. self-resolve
- **Performance Focused**: Target 90% self-resolution rate
- **Consistent Terminology**: Align with workflow patterns from `.copilot-instructions.md`

## Resolution Playbook System

### üéØ Primary Entry Point
**[hook-violation-resolution.md]** - Start here for all hook failures. Provides systematic diagnosis with decision trees to route to specific resolution templates.

### üîß Specialized Resolution Templates
1. **[package-manager-errors.md]** - Yarn vs npm violations, lockfile conflicts
2. **[eslint-errors.md]** - Code quality issues, linting rule violations
3. **[performance-errors.md]** - Hook timeout, memory, and slow execution issues
4. **[yarn-lock-conflict-resolution.md]** - Dependency conflicts and lockfile problems
5. **[emergency-overrides.md]** - Safe bypass procedures for critical situations

### üõ°Ô∏è Prevention and Setup
1. **[pre-commit-setup-validation.md]** - Hook installation, configuration, and troubleshooting
2. **[commit-quality-checklist.md]** - Proactive quality checks to prevent violations

## Message Categories

### üîß Primary Focus Areas
1. **Package Manager Violations** (`package-manager-errors.md`)
   - Yarn vs npm usage violations
   - Lockfile conflicts and inconsistencies
   - Workspace-specific package operations

2. **ESLint/Code Quality Failures** (`eslint-errors.md`)
   - Linting rule violations
   - Code style inconsistencies
   - Quality gate failures

3. **Performance Violations** (`performance-errors.md`)
   - Slow hook execution warnings
   - Timeout scenarios
   - Resource usage guidance

4. **Emergency Override Guidance** (`emergency-overrides.md`)
   - When and how to bypass hooks safely
   - Escalation procedures for urgent changes
   - Documentation requirements for overrides

## Usage by Hooks

### In Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Source the error message system
source .github/hooks/error-messages.sh

# Display educational error with context
show_package_manager_error "npm" "yarn" "$PWD"
```

### In Error Messages
Each template provides:
- **Context**: Why this rule exists
- **Fix Commands**: Copy-paste resolution steps
- **Validation**: How to verify the fix
- **Escalation**: When to ask for help
- **References**: Links to detailed documentation

## Integration with Workflow Patterns

### Consistent with .copilot-instructions.md
- Uses same terminology and command patterns
- References established development commands
- Maintains time-boxing principles (15-20 minute fixes)
- Follows escalation triggers from workflow

### Agent Communication Standards
- Status update patterns match existing templates
- Error acknowledgment follows established format
- Escalation paths align with project workflow

## Performance Targets

### Success Criteria
- **90% Self-Resolution**: Most violations fixed from error message alone
- **<5 Minute Resolution**: Standard fixes completed quickly
- **Clear Escalation**: Complex issues identified within 2 minutes
- **Educational Value**: Agents learn project standards through errors

### Measurement Approach
- Track resolution time per error type
- Monitor escalation rate by violation category
- Measure repeat violation frequency
- Agent feedback on message clarity

## Template Structure

Each error message template follows this structure:

```markdown
## üö® [Error Type] Detected

### üìö Why This Rule Exists
[Educational context about the rule's purpose]

### üîß Quick Fix (90% of cases)
[Copy-paste commands to resolve]

### üîç Verification Steps
[How to confirm the fix worked]

### üÜò When to Escalate
[Scenarios that require human help]

### üìñ Additional Resources
[Links to detailed documentation]
```

## File Organization

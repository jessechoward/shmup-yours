# Architecture Quick Reference

## Core Design (Single Source of Truth)
**Location**: `GAME_DESIGN.md` - Always reference this file for architectural decisions.

## Key Architectural Principles
1. **Single-server deployment** - No microservices, one Node.js process
2. **Single game world** - No rooms/lobbies, all players share same space
3. **In-memory state** - No database initially, game state in server memory
4. **WebSocket communication** - Real-time bidirectional messaging
5. **Handle-based identity** - Players reserve handles, no accounts/auth

## Critical Patterns
- **Game Loop**: 5-minute matches + 2-minute intermissions
- **Player States**: Active (playing) ‚Üí Inactive (timeout) ‚Üí Viewer (relegated)
- **Message Flow**: Client ‚Üî WebSocket ‚Üî Game Engine ‚Üî All Clients
- **State Sync**: Server is authoritative, clients receive updates

## Anti-Patterns (Do NOT implement)
- ‚ùå Room-based architecture
- ‚ùå Database persistence layer
- ‚ùå Authentication/user accounts
- ‚ùå Microservices separation
- ‚ùå REST API for game actions

## Dependencies
- Game engine must be completed before client communication
- WebSocket server must be set up before real-time features
- Handle reservation must work before player management
- Basic game loop before advanced features

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for game logic (isolated)
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication
- E2E tests for complete player workflows
- No database tests (in-memory only)

## üéÆ Game Technical Specifications

### Rendering Architecture
- **Game Engine**: Native HTML5 Canvas API (no external game libraries)
- **Viewport**: Fixed 1024√ó768 resolution
- **Game Style**: 2D top-down pixel art shooter
- **Map System**: Tilemap-based terrain with parallax background layers

### Visual Layer Structure
```
6. UI Overlay (HUD, chat, scores)
5. Game Objects (ships, projectiles, effects)  
4. Terrain Layer (space obstacles, boundaries)
3. Background Layer 3 (starmap - fastest parallax)
2. Background Layer 2 (starmap - medium parallax)
1. Background Layer 1 (starmap - slowest parallax)
```

### Art Direction
- **Inspiration**: SubSpace/Continuum maps with modern pixel art
- **Terrain Style**: Space junk, spaceport panels, pipes, geometric shapes
- **Philosophy**: Clean, minimal features - simplified compared to SubSpace
- **Collision**: Tile-based system for consistent physics

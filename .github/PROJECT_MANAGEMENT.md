# Project Management & GitHub Integration

## Overview
Hybrid approach combining code-based documentation with GitHub's native project management tools for AI agent workflow coordination.

## Documentation Strategy

### ðŸ“‹ Code-Based Documentation (Source of Truth)
**Location:** Repository root  
**Purpose:** Strategic planning and current state assessment  
**Update Frequency:** Weekly or after major milestones

- **`ROADMAP.md`** - Strategic vision, feature pipeline, technical decisions
- **`VERSION.md`** - Current state assessment, known issues, development status
- **`DESIGN.md`** - Architecture decisions, technology choices, rationale
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - Workflow guidelines, task templates, contribution process

### ðŸ”— GitHub Tools (Operational Management)
**Location:** GitHub interface  
**Purpose:** Day-to-day task coordination and dependency tracking  
**Update Frequency:** Real-time during development

- **Issues** - Task tracking, bug reports, feature requests
- **Projects** - Kanban boards for sprint planning and progress visualization
- **Discussions** - Community feedback, feature prioritization, Q&A
- **Milestones** - Release planning and progress tracking

## GitHub Project Board Setup

### Recommended Board Structure
```
ðŸ“‹ Backlog â†’ ðŸ”„ Ready â†’ ðŸ‘· In Progress â†’ ðŸ§ª Testing â†’ âœ… Done
```

**Backlog:** All identified tasks not yet prioritized  
**Ready:** Tasks with complete context, ready for implementation  
**In Progress:** Currently being worked on (limit: 3 tasks max)  
**Testing:** Implementation complete, undergoing validation  
**Done:** Completed and verified tasks

### Task Labeling System
- **Priority:** `p0-critical`, `p1-high`, `p2-medium`, `p3-low`
- **Size:** `size-s`, `size-m`, `size-l` (15-20min, requires breakdown, escalation)
- **Type:** `backend`, `frontend`, `testing`, `docs`, `research`
- **Status:** `blocked`, `waiting-review`, `needs-context`

## Issue Templates Integration

### Task Creation Workflow
1. **Use Issue Templates:** Select appropriate template from `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. **Auto-Assignment:** AI agent tasks automatically assigned to project maintainer
3. **Dependency Linking:** Use GitHub's "Closes #issue" syntax for dependency management
4. **Project Board Addition:** Auto-add to project board via GitHub automation

### Template Categories Available
- **User Story** - Feature requirements with acceptance criteria
- **Research Task** - Technical investigation with decision framework
- **Implementation** - Backend/frontend development tasks
- **Testing** - Quality assurance and validation tasks
- **Integration** - Component integration and E2E testing
- **Documentation** - Technical writing and knowledge capture
- **Bug Fix** - Issue resolution with reproduction steps

## Dependency Management

### GitHub Issue Linking
```markdown
## Dependencies
- Depends on: #123 (Backend API endpoints)
- Blocks: #456 (Frontend integration testing)
- Related: #789 (Performance optimization research)
```

### Dependency Validation
- **Before Starting:** Ensure all dependent issues are closed
- **During Development:** Update progress and link related PRs
- **Before Closing:** Verify all blocking issues can proceed

## Workflow Automation

### GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
# Auto-assign issues based on labels
# Auto-move cards based on PR status
# Auto-close issues when PRs merge
# Auto-create follow-up tasks for failed implementations
```

### Task Template Automation
- **Issue Creation:** Use templates to ensure complete context
- **Time-Boxing:** 15-20 minute task limits with escalation triggers
- **Quality Gates:** Automated checks before task completion
- **Handoff Process:** Clear next steps and context preservation

## Communication Patterns

### Status Updates
- **Daily:** Update issue comments with progress/blockers
- **Weekly:** Update VERSION.md with current development state
- **Milestone:** Update ROADMAP.md with feature pipeline changes
- **Release:** Community announcement via GitHub Discussions

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Task Overrun:** Comment on issue if >20 minutes, consider breaking down
2. **Blocked Tasks:** Move to "blocked" label, identify dependency issues
3. **Quality Issues:** Create bug fix issue, link to original implementation
4. **Scope Creep:** Create new issue for additional scope, keep original focused

## Metrics & Tracking

### Development Velocity
- **GitHub Insights:** Issue closure rate, PR cycle time
- **Task Completion:** Average time per task type and size
- **Quality Metrics:** Bug rate, rework frequency
- **Dependency Analysis:** Blocking issue resolution time

### Progress Reporting
```markdown
## Sprint Summary (Weekly)
**Completed:** 12 issues (8 backend, 4 frontend)
**In Progress:** 3 issues (2 testing, 1 integration)
**Blocked:** 1 issue (waiting for external dependency)
**Next Sprint:** Focus on multiplayer lobby completion
```

## AI Agent Coordination

### Task Assignment Strategy
- **Context Preservation:** All task templates include complete context
- **Incremental Development:** Small, focused tasks with clear handoffs
- **Quality Assurance:** Built-in testing and validation steps
- **Documentation:** Auto-generate follow-up documentation tasks

### Agent Handoff Process
1. **Task Completion:** Update issue with results and any discovered edge cases
2. **Context Transfer:** Document any assumptions or decisions made
3. **Next Steps:** Create follow-up issues if additional work identified
4. **Quality Check:** Ensure all acceptance criteria met before closing

## Integration Benefits

### Why This Hybrid Approach Works
- **Strategic Planning:** Code-based docs provide stable, version-controlled planning
- **Operational Flexibility:** GitHub tools adapt to changing priorities and dependencies
- **Community Engagement:** Public project boards and discussions encourage contribution
- **AI Agent Efficiency:** Templates and automation reduce context-switching overhead
- **Quality Assurance:** Multiple validation checkpoints prevent technical debt

### Maintenance Requirements
- **Weekly:** Review and update VERSION.md with current state
- **Bi-weekly:** Assess roadmap priorities and adjust feature pipeline
- **Monthly:** Clean up completed issues and archive old project boards
- **Quarterly:** Review and improve task templates based on usage patterns

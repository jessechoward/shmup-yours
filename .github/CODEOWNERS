## 🛡️ CODEOWNERS for shmup-yours
## Place this file in .github/ or at the repo root
## Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

### 🌍 Global Owners
# All files in the repository
* @jessechoward

### 📁 Folder Owners
# Assign owners for specific folders
/frontend/ @jessechoward
/backend/ @jessechoward
/test/ @jessechoward

### 👥 Multiple Owners & Teams
# Assign multiple owners (space-separated)
# /frontend/ @jessechoward @anotheruser
# Assign GitHub teams (prefix with @org/)
# /backend/ @yourorg/backend-team

### 🏷️ File Type Owners
# Use wildcards for file types
# *.js @jessechoward

### 🔒 Role-Based Permissions (for future use)
# CODEOWNERS only specifies who reviews/approves PRs for files/folders.
# To enforce who can merge to protected branches, use GitHub branch protection rules:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-code-owner-required-reviews
#
# Common roles:
#   👑 Owners: Must review/approve changes to their files
#   ✅ Approvers: Can approve PRs (must be listed as codeowners)
#   🔐 Mergers: Can merge to protected branches (set via branch protection, not CODEOWNERS)
#
# Example: Require code owner review before merging to main
#   - Set branch protection on main
#   - Enable "Require review from Code Owners"
#   - Only listed owners/teams can approve/merge

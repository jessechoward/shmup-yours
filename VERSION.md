## Feature Implementation Status

### üèóÔ∏è Foundation
- [x] **Monorepo Setup:** Yarn workspaces, package.json structure
- [x] **Task Templates:** Complete AI agent workflow system
- [x] **Documentation:** README, DESIGN, CONTRIBUTING, ROADMAP
- [x] **Docker Environment:** Development container configuration
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment
- [ ] **Testing Framework:** Jest (backend) + Vitest (frontend)

### üéÆ Core Gameplay (Not Started)
- [ ] **Multiplayer Lobby:** Room creation and player joining
- [ ] **Real-time Movement:** Player controls and physics
- [ ] **Combat System:** Bullets, mines, collision detection
- [ ] **Game State Sync:** Server-authoritative gameplay
- [ ] **Match System:** 5-minute matches with scoring

- [ ] **Touch Controls:** Mobile gameplay interface
- [ ] **PWA Features:** Offline capability and installation
- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing:** Safari, Chrome, Firefox compatibility

## Quality Gates Status
**Code Quality:** No linting rules configured yet  
**Test Coverage:** No test suite implemented yet  
**Performance:** No performance benchmarks established  
**Security:** No security audit completed  
**Accessibility:** No WCAG compliance testing done

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Backend Server Implementation:** Start with basic WebSocket multiplayer lobby
2. **Frontend Client Creation:** Basic HTML5 Canvas game interface
3. **Testing Framework Setup:** Configure Jest and Vitest with basic tests
4. **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions for automated testing
5. **Code Quality Tools:** ESLint, Prettier, and Git hooks

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk:** No working game implementation yet  
**Medium Risk:** Complex multiplayer synchronization challenges ahead  
**Low Risk:** Well-defined architecture and clear requirements  
**Mitigation:** MVP-first approach, incremental development

## Development Velocity
**Task Template System:** Fully operational with 15-20 minute time-boxing  
**Documentation Debt:** Minimal - comprehensive project documentation  
**Technical Debt:** None yet - project still in foundation phase  
**Blockers:** None identified - ready for core development

## Community Status
**Contributors:** 1 (project maintainer)  
**Open Issues:** 0 (clean slate)  
**Pull Requests:** 0 (no active development yet)  
**Community Interest:** Unknown - project not yet public

## Next Milestone Target
**Goal:** Functional multiplayer lobby with 2-4 players  
**Timeline:** Next 2 weeks (by 2025-07-27)  
**Success Criteria:** Players can join rooms and see each other moving  
**Risk Factors:** WebSocket implementation complexity, real-time sync challenges

---
**Assessment Method:** Manual review of codebase and documentation

# Task 2: Source of Truth Management Research

## Executive Summary (For Humans)

**Research Question:** How should we manage "source of truth" documents across our development ecosystem (workflow, architecture, conventions, etc.) to prevent scattered guidance and maintain consistency?

**Strategic Value:** Establishes reusable patterns for all future documentation challenges, not just workflow issues.

---

## Problem Statement (Detailed)

**Core Issue:** We repeatedly face the same challenge - critical guidance gets scattered across multiple documents, creating confusion and inconsistent implementation by both humans and AI agents.

**Examples:**
- Workflow rules spread across CONTRIBUTING.md, COPILOT_WORKFLOW.md, .copilot-instructions.md
- Architecture decisions buried in various READMEs and issue discussions
- Coding conventions duplicated inconsistently across workspace package.json files

**Strategic Impact:** Without systematic source-of-truth management, every new policy/convention will fragment over time, requiring manual maintenance and creating confusion.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goal
Investigate and recommend systematic approaches for maintaining authoritative documentation that:
1. **Prevents fragmentation** - single source, multiple references
2. **Enables consistency** - automated or simple sync mechanisms
3. **Scales efficiently** - works for workflow, architecture, conventions, etc.
4. **Balances automation vs simplicity** - avoids over-engineering

### Research Scope
**Applies to all documentation domains:**
- Development workflows and processes
- Architecture decisions and patterns
- Code conventions and standards
- Tool configurations and setup
- Project management and tracking

## Research Questions

### 1. **Source of Truth Patterns**
- What are proven patterns for authoritative documentation?
- How do successful projects handle scattered guidance?
- What formats best serve both humans and automation?

### 2. **Synchronization Approaches**
- What are 2-3 viable approaches for keeping references in sync?
- What are the maintenance costs vs benefits for each?
- Where should we draw automation vs manual process lines?

### 3. **Implementation Constraints**
- What approaches require minimal infrastructure setup?
- How can we avoid creating maintenance burdens?
- What solutions work with our current GitHub/Markdown/Mermaid stack?

## Expected Deliverables

### **Workspace Setup**
**Create dedicated research directory:** `research/source-of-truth-management/`
- This is pure research - no modifications to existing project files
- All outputs go in the research directory to avoid conflicts with Task 1
- Provides clean separation between tactical fixes and strategic research

### 1. **Problem Analysis Document**
**File:** `research/source-of-truth-management/01-problem-analysis.md`
- Clear articulation of the source-of-truth challenge
- Examples from our current codebase
- Impact assessment on development velocity

### 2. **Solution Investigation (2-3 Options)**
**File:** `research/source-of-truth-management/02-solution-investigation.md`
**For each option, document:**
- **Approach:** How it works conceptually
- **Implementation:** What would be required to set up
- **Maintenance:** Ongoing effort required
- **Pros/Cons:** Trade-offs and limitations
- **Fit Assessment:** How well it matches our constraints

### 3. **Comparative Analysis**
**File:** `research/source-of-truth-management/03-comparative-analysis.md`
- Side-by-side comparison of investigated options
- **Challenge each approach:** What could go wrong?
- **Constraint validation:** Does it meet our "minimal infrastructure" requirement?
- **Scalability test:** Would this work for architecture docs, conventions, etc.?

### 4. **Recommendation Summary**
**File:** `research/source-of-truth-management/04-executive-summary.md`
- **Top-level recommendation** with clear rationale
- **Implementation roadmap** with phases
- **Risk assessment** and mitigation strategies
- **Success metrics** for measuring effectiveness

## Research Constraints & Framework

### **Time Boxing (AI-Focused)**
- **Problem Analysis:** 30 minutes
- **Solution Investigation:** 60 minutes (20 min per option)
- **Comparative Analysis:** 30 minutes
- **Recommendation Summary:** 30 minutes
- **Total:** 2.5 hours maximum

### **Constraint Filters**
**Immediately exclude solutions that:**
- Require significant infrastructure setup
- Need dedicated tooling or servers
- Create high maintenance overhead
- Don't work with GitHub/Markdown ecosystem

### **Research Quality Framework**
- **Document challenges prominently** - what didn't work is often more valuable than what did
- **Include implementation reality checks** - can another agent actually implement this?
- **Challenge assumptions** - what looks good in theory but fails in practice?
- **Expose trade-offs clearly** - no silver bullets, honest assessment

## Success Criteria

✅ **Reusable framework** - applies beyond just workflow documentation  
✅ **Practical recommendations** - can be implemented with our constraints  
✅ **Decision transparency** - clear rationale for choices made  
✅ **Challenge documentation** - what was rejected and why  
✅ **Implementation roadmap** - clear next steps for adoption  
✅ **Risk awareness** - honest assessment of what could go wrong  

## Document Structure Requirements

### **Top Section (Human Summary)**
- Executive summary with key recommendation
- Quick reference for decision makers
- Clear action items and next steps

### **Detailed Sections (Reference Material)**
- Complete analysis with supporting evidence
- Implementation details and examples
- Challenge documentation and lessons learned
- Appendices with research notes and alternatives considered
